Xiaomi (小米) is the Chinese word for "millet".[119] In 2011 its CEO Lei Jun suggested there are more meanings than just the "millet and rice".[120] He linked the "Xiao" (小) part to the Buddhist concept that "a single grain of rice of a Buddhist is as great as a mountain",[121] suggesting that Xiaomi wants to work from the little things, instead of starting by striving for perfection,[120] while "mi" (米) is an acronym for Mobile Internet and also "mission impossible", referring to the obstacles encountered in starting the company.[120][122] He also stated that he thinks the name is cute.[120] In 2012 Lei Jun said that the name is about revolution and being able to bring innovation into a new area.[123] Xiaomi's new "Rifle" processor[124] has given weight to several sources linking the latter meaning to the Chinese Communist Party's "millet and rifle" (小米加步枪) revolutionary idiom[125][126] during the Second Sino-Japanese War.[127][128][129][130]

In 2013, critics debated how many of Xiaomi's products were innovative,[139][20][142] and how much of their innovation was just really good public relations.[142]
Others point out that while there are similarities to Apple, the ability to customize the software based upon user preferences through the use of Google's Android operating system sets Xiaomi apart.[143] Xiaomi has also developed a much wider range of consumer products than Apple.[104]
In January 2018, Xiaomi was criticized for its non-compliance with the terms of the GNU General Public License. The Android project's Linux kernel is licensed under the copyleft terms of the GPL, which requires Xiaomi to distribute the complete source code of the Android kernel and device trees for every Android device it distributes. By refusing to do so, or by unreasonably delaying these releases, Xiaomi is operating in violation of intellectual property law in China, as a WIPO state.[144] Prominent Android developer Francisco Franco publicly criticized Xiaomi's behaviour after repeated delays in the release of kernel source code.[145] Xiaomi in 2013 said that it would release the kernel code.[146] The kernel source code was available on the GitHub website in 2020.[147]
As a company based in China, Xiaomi is obligated to share data with the Chinese government under the China Internet Security Law and National Intelligence Law.[148][149] There were reports that Xiaomi's Cloud messaging service sends some private data, including call logs and contact information, to Xiaomi servers.[150][151] Xiaomi later released an MIUI update that made cloud messaging optional and that no private data was sent to Xiaomi servers if the cloud messaging service was turned off.[152]
On 23 October 2014, Xiaomi announced that it was setting up servers outside of China for international users, citing improved services and compliance to regulations in several countries.[153]

On 30 April 2020, Forbes reported that Xiaomi extensively tracks use of its browsers, including private browser activity, phone metadata and device navigation, and more alarmingly, without secure encryption or data anonymization, more invasively and to a greater extent than mainstream browsers. Xiaomi disputed the claims, while confirming that it did extensively collect browsing data, and saying that the data was not linked to any individuals and that users had consented to being tracked.[158] Xiaomi posted a response stating that the collection of aggregated usage statistics data is used for internal analysis, and would not link any personally identifiable information to any of this data.[159] However, after a follow-up by Gabriel Cirlig, the writer of the report, Xiaomi added an option to completely stop the information leak when using its browser in incognito mode.[160]
In September 2021, amidst a political spat between China and Lithuania, the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence urged people to dispose the Chinese-made mobile phones and avoid buying new ones,[161] after the National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania claimed that Xiaomi devices have built-in censorship capabilities that can be turned on remotely.[162]
Xiaomi denied the accusations, saying that it "does not censor communications to or from its users", and that they would be engaging a third-party to assess the allegations. They also stated that regarding data privacy, it was compliant with two frameworks for following Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), namely its ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management Standards and the ISO/IEC 27701 Privacy Information Management System.[163]
In November 2012, Xiaomi's smart set-top box stopped working one week after the launch due to the company having run foul of China's National Radio and Television Administration.[164][165][166] The regulatory issues were overcome in January 2013.[167]
The Taiwanese Fair Trade Commission investigated the flash sales and found that Xiaomi had sold fewer smartphones than advertised.[168] Xiaomi claimed that the number of smartphones sold was 10,000 units each for the first two flash sales, and 8,000 units for the third one. However, FTC investigated the claims and found that Xiaomi sold 9,339 devices in the first flash sale, 9,492 units in the second one, and 7,389 for the third.[169] It was found that during the first flash sale, Xiaomi had given 1,750 priority ‘F-codes’ to people who could place their orders without having to go through the flash sale, thus diminishing the stock that was publicly available. The FTC fined Xiaomi NT$600,000.[170]
In March 2014, Xiaomi Store Australia (an unrelated business) began selling Xiaomi mobile phones online in Australia through its website, XiaomiStore.com.au.[171] However, Xiaomi soon requested that the store be shut down by 25 July 2014.[171] On 7 August 2014, shortly after sales were halted, the website was taken down.[171] An industry commentator described the action by Xiaomi to get the Australian website closed down as unprecedented, saying, "I’ve never come across this [before]. It would have to be a strategic move."[171] At the time this left only one online vendor selling Xiaomi mobile phones into Australia, namely Yatango (formerly MobiCity), which was based in Hong Kong.[171] This business closed in late 2015.[172]
On 9 December 2014, the Delhi High Court granted an ex parte injunction that banned the import and sale of Xiaomi products in India. The injunction was issued in response to a complaint filed by Ericsson in connection with the infringement of its patent licensed under reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing.[173] The injunction was applicable until 5 February 2015, the date on which the High Court was scheduled to summon both parties for a formal hearing of the case. On 16 December, the High Court granted permission to Xiaomi to sell its devices running on a Qualcomm-based processor until 8 January 2015.[174] Xiaomi then held various sales on Flipkart, including one on 30 December 2014. Its flagship Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G phone sold out in six seconds.[175] A judge extended the division bench's interim order, allowing Xiaomi to continue the sale of Qualcomm chipset-based handsets until March 2018.[176]
In January 2021, towards the end of the presidency of Donald Trump, the United States government named Xiaomi as a company "owned or controlled" by the People's Liberation Army and thereby prohibited any American company or individual from investing in it.[177] However, the investment ban was blocked by a US court ruling after Xiaomi filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with the court expressing skepticism regarding the government's national security concerns.[178] Xiaomi denied the allegations of military ties and stated that its products and services were of civilian and commercial use.[179] In May 2021, Xiaomi reached an agreement with the Defense Department to remove the designation of the company as military-linked.[180]
On 19 January 2021, KPN, a Dutch landline and mobile telecommunications company, sued Xiaomi and others for patent infringement. KPN filed similar lawsuits against Samsung in 2014 and 2015 in a court in the US.[181]
In July 2021, Xiaomi submitted a report to Amazon alleging that Wyze Labs had infringed upon its 2019 "Autonomous Cleaning Device and Wind Path Structure of Same" robot vacuum patent.

In April 2022, India's Enforcement Directorate seized assets from Xiaomi as part of an investigation into violations of foreign exchange laws.[183] The asset seizure was subsequently put on hold by a court order, but later upheld.[94][184][185][186]
After the beginning of Russian invasion of Ukraine Xiaomi reported the suspension of operations in Russia, but in July 2022, Xiaomi and its sub-brand POCO together held 42% of the Russian smartphone market, ranking first in terms of sales.[187] On 13 April 2023 Xiaomi Corporation and 13 Xiaomi officials (responsible key management), namely Lei Jun, Lin Bin, Lu Weibing, Liu De, Zhang Feng, Zeng Xuezhong, Yan Kesheng, Lam Sai Wai Alain, Zhu Dan, Wang Xiaoyan, Qu Heng, Ma Ji and Yu Man, were listed by Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) on their list of "international sponsors of war"[188] because the company continued its operations in Russia after Russia's invasion and remained a leader in smartphone sales there.[188][189][190]
Chinese smartphone brands continued to gain market share in Russia filling the gap left by Western brands which withdrew following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to a local retailer.[191]
On 21 September 2023, Telia, DNA, and Elisa, Finland's major mobile carriers, halted the sale of Xiaomi Technology products due to the company's ongoing business activities in Russia.[192] This decision reflects the company's commitment to maintaining its operations in Russia despite the Ukraine invasion. The Finnish carriers' move came after Xiaomi faced several challenges in its European business in 2023. In March and April, Poland and Lithuania prohibited the sale of its products, while the European Union imposed sanctions[193] on Xiaomi's CEO, Lei Jun.
The sanctions imposed on Xiaomi are a component of the EU's broader strategy aimed at urging Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. In addition to this, the EU has implemented a ban on exporting various goods to Russia, including semiconductors crucial for smartphone manufacturing. Xiaomi's ongoing operations in Russia have sparked debate. While the company asserts its obligation to serve Russian customers and support its employees, some contend that it indirectly supports the Russian government financially.[194]
Xiaomi's mobile device manufacturing plant was inaugurated on 4 March 2022, to begin production in Pakistan. The plant was set up in conjunction with Select Technologies (Pvt) Limited, an Air Link fully owned subsidiary. The production plant is located in Lahore.[195]
